There are mods, including Vanilla Expanded ones which add many chemfuel operated objects to the game. However, none of them can be refueled or interacted with using Rimefeller pipes.

This is where this mod comes in. It allows you to automatically refuel Vanilla Expanded things with the use of convenient pipes placed right under them.

Please note: by default only small amount of objects is supported. To enable more, you need to go into Vanilla Expanded Framework settings and enable more there.

By default, infinite chemreactor (vanilla), chemfuel pump (1.3, Vanilla Furniture - Power), pipeline junction (Vanilla Factions - Ancients), bioreactor (BioReactor), and refueling pump (Vanilla Vehicles Expanded) can be refueled/drained by your Rimefeller tanks. Pipeline junction still needs hacking first, and the buildings will still drop chemfuel on ground if your chemfuel tanks are full.

Full list of supported mods (depending on RimWorld version):

- Advanced Chemfuel Generator
- Appliances Expanded
- BioReactor
- Chemfuel Powered Portable Generator
- Comigo's Nutrition
- Higher Power
- M-13's ChemFuel Generators
- Simple Utilities: Wall
- Transport Cargo Pod
- Transport Shuttle Standalone
- Vanilla Factions Expanded - Ancients
- Vanilla Factions Expanded - Settlers
- Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Power
- Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Security
- Vanilla Vehicles Expanded

Sadly, no support for factories from Vanilla Factions - Mechanoids. They're a bit complex and require a bit more work to get working properly.
